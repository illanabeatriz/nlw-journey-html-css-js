<h2 id="about">💻 About</h2>

Plann.er is the simplified version of a responsive travel itinerary application, and was proposed as the main project of the 16th edition of Next Level Week Journey (promoted by [Rocketseat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/)).

This repository presents the result obtained through the HTML + CSS + JS path.

The code was written and tested on [fronteditor.dev](https://www.fronteditor.dev/), an online editor that works in any browser and allows immediate visualization of the developed application. Furthermore, as it is a front-end project, access to the project interface located in Figma was made available to consult the specifications relating to the UI design.
